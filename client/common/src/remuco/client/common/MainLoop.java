/**
 * Global main loop, supposed to be used for
 * <ul>
 * <li>handling events from a {@link Connection} (decoupled from the
 * {@link Connection}'s receiver thread and from the threads calling methods on
 * a {@link Connection}),
 * <li>scheduling repetitive tasks,
 * <li>scheduling delayed tasks and
 * <li>synchronizing access to objects where critical race conditions may occur.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <em>Note:</em> The methods {@link #enable()} and {@link #disable()} should
 * get called only from the application's entry and exit points to prevent race
 * conditions and to ensure other methods (<em>schedule...</em>) are not called
 * before {@link #enable()} or after {@link #disable()}. Further, methods in
 * this class should be called only from a non-static context (otherwise there
 * is a risk they get called during class initializations before
 * {@link #enable()} has been called the first time).
