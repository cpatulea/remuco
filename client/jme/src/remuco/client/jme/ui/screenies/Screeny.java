/**
 * Screenies are the pieces which compose the {@link PlayerScreen}.
 * <p>
 * A screeny represents some data in form of an image (so called
 * <i>representation image</i>). It knows its position and size so it can draw
 * itself (i.e. its representation images) into a {@link Graphics} object via
 * {@link #draw(Graphics)} and give information where to place adjacent
 * screenies (see {@link #getNextX()} and {@link #getNextY()} etc.).
 * <p>
 * A screeny creates its <em>representation image</em> using graphical data from
 * {@link Theme}. So when ever the {@link Theme} changes,
 * {@link #initRepresentation(int, int, int, int)} must get called by classes
 * which use screenies. This method must also get called when a screeny's
 * position or the available screen size changes. This is mostly a consequence
 * of a change in {@link Theme}. Screeny implementations must ensure that the
 * size of their representation images does <em>not</em> change between two
 * calls to {@link #initRepresentation(int, int, int, int)}. On the other side,
 * a screeny user must ensure that this method gets called before the above
 * mentioned <code>update(..)</code> method gets called the first time.
 * <p>
 * <h5>Simple summary:</h5>
 * The input of a screeny is some data and the output is a corresponding image
 * which can be drawn with {@link #draw(Graphics)} into an {@link Graphics}
 * object.
 * <p>
 * <h5>Special types of screenies:</h5>
 * Conceptually there are 2 special types of screenies: container screenies
 * (e.g. {@link StateScreeny}) and generic screenies (e.g. {@link ButtonScreeny}
 * ). Container screenies are screenies which contain screenies themselves.
 * Generic screenies are screenies whose appearance and behavior (pointer
 * handling) is configured by constructor parameters.
 * <p>
 * <h5>Notes for subclasses:</h5>
 * Whenever the data to present by a screeny gets updated,
 * {@link #dataUpdated()} will be called. However this is just for notification
 * and mainly intended for <em>container</em> screenies to forward the data
 * update to sub screenies. The actual updating of the screeny's representation
 * image must be done later, in {@link #updateRepresentation()}.
