Remuco - Remote media player control

Remuco is a duplex remote control system for Linux media players and mobile
devices equipped with Bluetooth or WiFi. With Remuco, you can remotely control
your favorite media player. You can switch to the next, previous, or any other
media within the current playlist, browse your media library and activate other
playlists, rate your media, adjust volume, and more. On the mobile device (the
remote control), it displays information about the current media, including
cover art.

2. Installation

Run

 $ make help
 
to get instructions on how to install Remuco for one or more media players.

Next, install the client application on your mobile device. You find the
required JAR and JAD files in the directory 'client/app'.
How to install is device dependent - please consult the documentation of your
mobile device.

Note: If you installed Remuco using packages for your distribution, the client
      files usually are located in /usr/share/remuco/client/. 

Note: The source only package (remuco-source-x.x.x.tar.gz) does not contain
      the client binaries. Read sections "Client Development" and
      "Packager Information" for how to build the client.

Note: If the client fails to start on your mobile, have a look at
      http://code.google.com/p/remuco/wiki/ClientCustomization for possible
      reasons and solutions.

3. Usage

3.1 Player Adapters

Some player adapters need to get started manually, others get started
automatically when the corresponding player application starts. Please visit
http://code.google.com/p/remuco/wiki/GettingStarted for player specific
information.

Each player adapter has a configuration file ~/.config/remuco/<PLAYER>/conf.
Edit this file if needed. Logging output of a player adapter goes to
~/.cache/remuco/<PLAYER>/log.

3.2 Client

Using the client is not too complicated, just start and use it ;) .

Nevertheless, you'll find some usage information here:
http://code.google.com/p/remuco/wiki/GettingStarted

3.3 Report

Remuco comes with a tool called remuco-report. This tool submits information
of seen Remuco client devices to the Remuco project. Help setting up a Remuco
compatible device list, by using remuco-report! See the tool's man page for
more information.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

4. Player Adapter Development

To develop a player adapter, use 'fooplay' as a template and implement it as
described in the file 'api.html'.

To test the fooplay adapter, simply run it as a Python script. It requires the
Python module 'remuco' which is available if you installed another player
adapter before. Otherwise, just add '<pkg-root>/base/module' to PYTHONPATH
before running the fooplay adapter. For instance

$ PYTHONPATH=<pkg-root>/base/module <pkg-root>/adapter/fooplay/remuco-fooplay

starts the fooplay adapter without installing anything. Try it, it's easy :)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

5. Client Development

As a quick start, change into the directory <pkg-root>/client and run setup.sh
to set up the client build environment and to get further instructions.

More detailed information can be found at:
http://code.google.com/p/remuco/wiki/ClientCustomization

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

6. Packager Information

Packagers should not use the top level make file -- this is a wrapper around
'setup.py'. Instead use setup.py directly, which installs all Remuco components
(base, player adapters and client binaries) by default. To install only some
components, the environment variable REMUCO_COMPONENTS may be set appropriately.
Additionally some more environment variables may be used to adjust the
installation process. Just search for 'os.getenv' within setup.py to get more
detailed information.

If your distribution requires source only packages, use the package
remuco-source-x.x.x.tar.gz. Building the client requires Ant (including
optional tasks), ProGuard and JavaME libraries. You can use JavaME libraries
from SUN's Wireless Toolkit, from the MicroEmu project or generate them from
scratch as described in client/ligben/README.
