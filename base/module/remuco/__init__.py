"""Remuco player adapter module.

The module 'remuco' provides classes and constants for Remuco player adapters.

Class PlayerAdapter:
    Base class for player adapters (start reading here).

Class MPRISAdapter:
    Base class for player adapters for MPRIS players.

Classes ItemAction and ListAction:
    Classes to define actions clients may execute in their media browser. 

Class ListReply:
    Used by player adapters to reply requests for playlists and other lists.

Class Manager:
    Helper class for managing the life cycle of a player adapter.

Constants:
    The constants starting with 'INFO' are keys to be used for the dictionary
    describing an item (a playable object: song, video, slide, picture, ...).
    
    The constants starting with 'PLAYBACK' are the values used by Remuco to
    describe a playback state.

Logging:
    It is recommended to use the remuco logging system within player adapters.
    To do so, import the module 'remuco.log' and use the functions
    
    * remuco.log.debug(),
    * remuco.log.info(),
    * remuco.log.warning() and
    * remuco.log.error().
    
    Then all messages of the player adapter will be written into the same file
    as used internally by the remuco module - that makes debugging a lot easier.
    
    Internally Remuco uses the module 'logging' for all its logging messages.
    Messages go into a player specific log file (usually
    ~/.cache/remuco/PLAYER/log). The log level is defined in a player specific
    configuration file (usually ~/.config/remuco/PLAYER/conf).
